## Authors

## Environment

### Structure 

The sandbox is seeded with agents that have the ability to form alliances. Alliances have leaders and can dominate or cooperate with other alliances to maximize their utility.

1. War
2. Peace
3. Trade
4. Expansion
5. Betrayal

### World Generation

The world is randomly generated and various resources exist. Alliances form in different areas (like settlements) based on the location of strategic resources.

Alliances have the ability to trade, expand, dominate, etc.
